# Carbon-Footprint-Project

An Android app that I worked on, which tracks a user's carbon footprint. The folder "be" contains the code for the back end server.

The app allows users to submit a daily log of their activities such as travel and diet, as well as electric and gas bills. The data they input is uploaded to the server, which estimates their carbon footprint, and returns the estimate to the user. Users can see a summary and history of their carbon footprint. They are also given an option to report "offsets". By visiting a third party web page, users can choose to donate to plant a tree or purchase an "offset" to their carbon footprint. In the app, they simply report their purchased offset, and the server will calculate their reduced footprint.

I unfortunately had to remove the commit history in order to protect some sensitive information which used to be in the source code.
